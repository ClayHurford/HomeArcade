# HomeArcade
The home arcade is made up of fun little games used to learn about different libraries and tutorials to keep my coding skills fresh.
A fair amount of these programs were built based off of tutorials to start learning about the different libraries such as Kivy and Arcade.
They are primarily focused on introducing myself to game logic as well as a fun passtime to start building my skills and continue my
problem solving.
